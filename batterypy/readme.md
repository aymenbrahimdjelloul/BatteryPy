# How It Works

BatteryPy provides comprehensive battery monitoring capabilities across Windows and Linux systems by leveraging platform-specific APIs and system utilities. The library intelligently detects your operating system and uses the most appropriate methods to retrieve accurate battery information.

## Cross-Platform Architecture

BatteryPy employs a multi-layered approach to battery monitoring, ensuring reliable data collection regardless of your operating system:

### Windows Systems
On Windows platforms, BatteryPy utilizes several robust methods to gather battery information:

- **Win32_Battery WMI API**: Interfaces directly with Windows Management Instrumentation to access real-time battery status, including charge level, health metrics, and power state
- **WMIC (Windows Management Instrumentation Command-line)**: Executes system-level queries to retrieve detailed battery specifications and historical data
- **PowerCfg Integration**: Generates and parses comprehensive battery reports using Windows' built-in `powercfg` utility, extracting detailed battery health information from the generated HTML reports
- **System Power APIs**: Accesses Windows power management APIs for additional battery state information

### Linux Systems
For Linux environments, BatteryPy taps into the system's power management infrastructure:

- **sysfs Interface**: Reads battery information directly from `/sys/class/power_supply/` directory structure
- **upower Integration**: Leverages the Linux power management service for comprehensive battery statistics
- **ACPI Data**: Accesses Advanced Configuration and Power Interface data for detailed battery specifications
- **proc Filesystem**: Retrieves battery information from `/proc/acpi/battery/` when available

## Data Collection Process

1. **System Detection**: Automatically identifies the operating system and available battery monitoring interfaces
2. **Multi-Source Verification**: Cross-references data from multiple sources to ensure accuracy
3. **Real-Time Updates**: Continuously monitors battery status changes and updates information accordingly
4. **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles system-specific limitations and provides fallback methods when primary sources are unavailable

## Key Features

- **Battery Health Assessment**: Calculates wear level and capacity degradation over time
- **Charging Cycle Tracking**: Monitors charge/discharge cycles to assess battery lifespan
- **Power Consumption Analysis**: Tracks power usage patterns and estimates remaining battery life
- **Historical Data**: Maintains battery performance history for trend analysis
- **Multi-Battery Support**: Handles systems with multiple batteries (laptops with removable batteries, etc.)

This comprehensive approach ensures that BatteryPy delivers consistent, accurate battery monitoring across different hardware configurations and operating systems.

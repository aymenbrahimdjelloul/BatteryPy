## **How It Works**

BatteryPy makes it easy to monitor battery information such as battery health and much more on any laptop device that uses a battery. It uses multiple methods and tools to retrieve, gather, and parse battery information. Tools like the **Win32_Battery** API and **WMIC** in Windows systems are used to get battery specs. It also uses the battery report HTML file generated by `powercfg` to extract battery information.

## Usage

~~~python
# First import the Battery class object from the BatteryPy module
from batterypy import Battery

# Create battery class object
battery = Battery()

# Print out the battery percentage
print(battery.battery_percentage)
